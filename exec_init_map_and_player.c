/*
pos_x and pos_y represent the position vector of the player, dir_x and dir_y 
represent the direction of the player, and plane_x and plane_y the camera plane
 of the player. 
FOV is 2 * atan(0.66/1.0)=66Â°is perfect for a first person shooter game
Camera->plane_x : left side of the screen will get coordinate -1, the center 
of the screen gets coordinate 0, and the right side of the screen gets 
coordinate 1.
Camera->plane_y : upper side of the screen will get coordinate -1, the center
of the screen gets coordinate 0, and the down side of the screen gets
coordinate 1.
So : 
North means y = -1
South means y = 1;
West means x = -1;
East means x = 1;
Thanks to this the direction of the ray will be calculated (sum of the 
direction vector, and a part of the plane vector. This has to be done 
both for the x and y coordinate of the vector (since adding two vectors 
is adding their x-coordinates, and adding their y-coordinates)
Later on when rotating around with the input keys, the values of dir
 and plane will be changed, but they'll always remain perpendicular and 
 keep the same length.
